Goodness is what we care about.  We want good outcomes, good experiences, good feelings and good relationships.  We'd like the world and everything in it to be good.  Goodness is the ultimate objective for ourselves and for everything there is.

Just knowing what goodness is can be very hard, let alone achieving it.  The purpose of this book is to serve as a repository of the world's knowledge on goodness.  It will describe goodness.  It will explain how goodness can be achieved.  It will provide much-needed motivation and inspiration.

Because the topic is unimaginably big and difficult, this book does not have an author.  Instead, the book is open to contribution from anyone.  Add to it.  Edit it.  Delete parts.  Create a branch.  Infuse it with your own goodness.  Help make it a little better.  If it is to be greater than all of us, it must reflect the best of each of us.  

May you achieve goodness.
